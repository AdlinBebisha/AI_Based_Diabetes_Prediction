â€¢ This repository consists of files required to deploy a ___Web App___ created with ___Flask___ on ___Microsoft___ Azure.# diabetes_predictor
The project helps the user to identify whether someone is suffering from diabetes by simply inputting certain values like BMI, Glucose level, Blood pressure etc. with the help of a Kaggle database.

In this project we are using Random Forest Algoritnm to predict the Diabetes

By using the statistical data about how certain aspects like BMI, Glucose level, Insulin level, age etc. impact if an individual is prone to diabetes or not, the project will be able to tell the user if the person has diabetes or not by entering those values. So in a way the project will help in monitoring the likelihood of someone developing diabetes. 

For running this code we wanna create a python project in Pycharm and install following python packages
Flask --> 2.0.2
gunicorn --> 20.1.0
itsdangerous --> 2.0.1
Jinja2 --> 3.0.3
MarkupSafe --> 2.0.1
Werkzeug --> 2.0.2
numpy --> 1.21.4
scipy --> 1.7.1
scikit-learn --> 0.20
matplotlib --> 3.5.0
pandas --> 1.3.4

we can access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Enter the required health-related information, such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, and more.

Click the "Predict" button to receive an instant prediction of your likelihood of having diabetes.
